# Domain authoring

Use Microsoft AgentSchema YAML for agents. Reusable procedures use the
Microsoft Agent Skills `SKILL.md` format. The reusable domain-authoring
guidance is in this document and the pstack prompt set under
`docs/prompts/`.

Start by copying the shape of the included
[`land-administration` domain](../domains/land-administration/), then change
the vocabulary and responsibilities for your domain.

## Smallest useful shape

```text
domains/my-domain/
  domain.md
  agents/evidence-reviewer.agent.yaml
  skills/evidence-analysis/SKILL.md
  flows/review.flow.md
```

The runtime only needs the artifact types your domain uses. A good first
domain has one clear input, one focused agent, and one flow.

## Authoring sequence

1. Define the domain vocabulary, source-of-truth rules, and safety boundaries.
2. Write one agent with explicit inputs, outputs, and one responsibility.
3. Extract reusable procedures into a skill.
4. Connect the agent in a flow and describe ordering, failures, and human
   review.
5. List the domain and run the flow before adding more agents.

## Agent files

An agent file is canonical Microsoft AgentSchema YAML. Repository-specific
version and runtime metadata belong under `metadata.businessAgent`:

```yaml
 $schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/AgentSchema/main/schemas/v1.0/PromptAgent.yaml
 kind: prompt
 name: evidence-reviewer
 displayName: Evidence Reviewer
 description: Review supplied evidence for one focused responsibility.
 model: ${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
 instructions: |
   Review the supplied evidence and preserve uncertainty.
 metadata:
   businessAgent:
     version: 1.0.0
     inputs: [source bundle]
     outputs: [evidence assessment]
     referencedSkills: [../skills/evidence-analysis/SKILL.md]
     permittedTools: [read]
```

The `instructions` block should define responsibility, boundaries, procedure,
and output requirements. Keep one primary responsibility per agent. Do not put
flow sequencing or multi-agent coordination in an agent file.

## Skills

Skills contain reusable procedures and guardrails. They may be referenced by
multiple agents. Skills must state their boundaries and should distinguish
facts, assumptions, unknowns, and human-review requirements.

## Flows

Flows identify participating agents and describe ordering, parallel branches,
failure behavior, conflict preservation, and synthesis. A flow may recommend
parallel execution, but the current mock runner executes agents sequentially.

Keep the flow readable enough that a person can explain it without opening
the runtime code. A useful flow answers three questions: what happens first,
what can happen independently, and what must be true before synthesis or
human approval.

For example, the included flow makes the sequence explicit:

```text
case bundle → intake → specialist reviews → synthesis → human confirmation
```

The current mock runner executes declared steps sequentially, even when a
flow identifies independent specialist branches.

## Safety and quality

- Do not invent domain facts or jurisdiction-specific requirements.
- Preserve source provenance and material conflicts.
- Treat missing configuration as unknown, not as evidence of compliance.
- Require human review before consequential or legally meaningful action.
- Define explicit inputs and outputs for every agent.
- Keep provider-specific tool declarations separate where possible.

Before calling a domain finished, check that every agent has a bounded
responsibility, every flow names its failure behavior, unknowns are preserved,
and consequential actions still require human confirmation.
