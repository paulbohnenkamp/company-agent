# Business Agent architecture

Business Agent keeps domain behavior in readable YAML/Markdown artifacts and keeps execution
mechanics in TypeScript. New business domains normally add configuration, not
runtime classes. Stateful application boundaries use small cohesive services.

Think of a review as a small team with a playbook. The **flow** is the
playbook, each **agent** owns one job, **skills** are reusable techniques, and
the **orchestrator** keeps the work ordered and recorded.

## Concepts

| Concept | Responsibility | File convention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | Vocabulary, policies, schemas, source-of-truth rules | `domain.md` |
| Agent | One specialized responsibility | `<id>.agent.yaml` using Microsoft AgentSchema |
| Skill | Reusable procedure or domain knowledge | `<id>/SKILL.md` |
| Prompt | Focused reusable model-facing text | `<id>.prompt.md` |
| Instructions | Shared operating constraints | `<id>.instructions.md` |
| Flow | Steps, dependencies, branches, and synthesis | `<id>.flow.md` |
| RunService | Owns run execution, handoffs, persistence, and review transitions | `src/core/orchestrator.ts` |
| FoundryClient | Owns Microsoft Responses API request/response concerns | `src/microsoft/foundry.ts` |
| RetrievalProvider | Supplies grounded documents with provenance | `src/core/ports.ts` |
| TelemetrySink | Receives run/agent events | `src/core/ports.ts` |
| ConsequentialActionGateway | Guards external writes and communications | `src/core/ports.ts` |
| Orchestrator | Compatibility functions delegating to `RunService` | TypeScript runtime |
| Runtime | Persistence, validation, status, and audit | TypeScript runtime |

## Domain layout

```text
domains/<domain-id>/
  domain.md
  agents/<agent-id>.agent.yaml
  skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md
  prompts/<prompt-id>.prompt.md
  instructions/<instruction-id>.instructions.md
  flows/<flow-id>.flow.md
```

Only the artifact types a domain needs must be present. The generated
`domains/land-administration/` pack is the reference example.

## Execution model

The current mock executor runs the agents listed by a flow in declaration
order and writes:

```text
<workspace>/runs/<run-id>/
  input.md
  run.json
  agents/<agent-id>.md
```

The run record preserves the selected domain and flow, versions, status,
output paths, and errors. Agents do not directly edit the final user-facing
review during orchestrated execution.

For example, the land-administration flow uses intake first, then two
specialist reviews, then synthesis. The specialists report findings; the
synthesizer preserves conflicts and proposes a route for human confirmation.
That same shape can support permitting, case management, or other
domains without changing the runtime concepts.

## Provider boundary

The `AgentExecutor` interface is the provider boundary. The current
implementation is deterministic and offline. A Foundry executor seam exists
in `src/microsoft/foundry.ts`; it is not wired as a default and requires
endpoint credentials. The MCP layer currently provides a permissioned catalog
seam, not a network transport/server. Neither cloud integration is claimed as
live or production-tested here.

## Design conventions

Use pure functions for parsing, validation, calculations, grading, and other
transformations. Use a class or application service when behavior owns state,
injected dependencies, persistence, an external client, or a lifecycle
transition. Keep one cohesive responsibility per module; avoid generic
`utils` dumping grounds, static global state, deep inheritance, and hidden
dependencies. `AGENTS.md` contains the contributor version of these rules.
