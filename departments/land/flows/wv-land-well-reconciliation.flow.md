# WV Land Well Reconciliation Flow

Run the required steps in order: intake, reconciliation, and synthesis.
Normalized evidence and Phase 4 deterministic results enter before judgment.
Each structured result is validated before it becomes the next artifact.

Required-step execution failures remain failures, block dependent steps, and
prevent successful completion. A successfully executed judgment may instead
produce an unknown, conflict, or inconclusive finding. WVDEP and WVGES
evidence remains independent. Phase 5 returns transient structured output and
does not persist findings or execute consequential actions.
