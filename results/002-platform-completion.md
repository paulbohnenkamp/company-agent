# Platform completion result

## What changed

The repository now has a documentation map and dedicated architecture, data
model, flow-runtime, evaluation, and safety guides. The runtime records prior
agent handoffs, explicit human-review status, and approval transitions. Local
retrieval returns provenance. Evaluation cases have structured envelopes,
adversarial suites, summaries, and a runnable command. Tool input validation,
MCP catalog validation, and fake-provider Foundry tests are included.

## Files changed

See `git diff` or the repository tree for the complete set. Important areas are
`docs/`, `src/core/`, `src/evaluations/`, `src/retrieval/`, `src/mcp/`,
`src/microsoft/`, `evaluations/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`.

## Checks and results

- TypeScript type-check: passed.
- Automated tests: 21 passed, 0 failed.
- Next production build: passed.
- Cloud execution: not run; credentials and service setup are intentionally
  absent.

## Remaining follow-ups

Live Foundry evaluation, Azure AI Search/Blob integration, Entra identity,
network MCP transport, production telemetry, structured model output schemas,
and true parallel graph scheduling remain separate implementation slices.

## Checks run and results

Verification evidence is preserved in the original result content; unresolved limits are called out in docs/PROJECT_STATE.md.

## Deviations from the spec

No deviation is inferred by this metadata normalization. Review the original result content for slice-specific deviations.

## Important decisions

This slice remains first-class project history. The current product direction is recorded in docs/PROJECT_STATE.md.
